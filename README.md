# ucf-raw-data-server
This server uses the [ucf-parking API](https://github.com/Stephan-Hartig/ucf-parking) to routinely fetch data from the [UCF Parking & Transportation website](https://secure.parking.ucf.edu/GarageCount/) and store it into a MySQL database.

## Building
To compile the typescript run
```
   npx tsc --project ./
```
and then run it with node or with a watchdog.
